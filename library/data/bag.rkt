; Bag ADT
; =======
;
; Bags, as the name suggests, store objects without any
; order. That is: when you would iterate over them, you
; can never be sure which one you will encounter first.
;
; A second property of bags is that they can store multiple
; data instances that are equal. When removing them, only the
; item that is matched first is wiped out.
