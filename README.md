Simple Racket Game Library
==========================

This is a small library written in racket that aims to make developing
games with the native racket/gui library more convenient.

## Features ##

 - Fully event-driven mouse and keyboard
 - Buffered frames preventing flicker
 - Speed optimizations
 - Advanced drawing procedures
 - Multiple game-loops

## Usage ##

There are multiple choices, depending on your programming style: `canvas.rkt` imports the simplified library
(recommended for beginners) while `objective.rkt` includes the full object-oriented library. You can also use
`procedural.rkt`, which provides only procedural bindings (experimental).

Please read the [wikipages](http://github.com/samvv/racket-gaming/wiki)
for more information on how to use this library.

If you encouter bugs please submit them to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/samvv/racket-gaming/issues).
You are free to patch the code yourself, and it would be greatly appreciated if you could
[pull](https://github.com/samvv/racket-gaming/pulls) the modifications afterwards.

Feature requests can also be submitted to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/samvv/racket-gaming/issues)
or alernatively they can be placed as a comment to one of the source files. Those who are

## Credits ##

Library created and maintained by Sam Vervaeck.

Thanks to Adriaan Leynse for the original concept and
providing an exemplary implementation using racket/gui.

This library is a fork of the library provided by the
[Software Languages Lab](http://soft.vub.ac.be/soft/edu/teaching) as
part of one of their courses. A full backport to this library
has been provided in *canvas.rkt*. Use *graphics/canvas.rkt*  in
order to use racket-gaming as a back-en instead of the old library.
 
The libraries that have been of use are stored in the folder *references*.
